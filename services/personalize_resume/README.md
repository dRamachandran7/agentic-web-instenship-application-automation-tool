# personalize_resume

Takes the user's resume as raw LaTeX source and the `values` a listing is
looking for (analyze_listing's output), makes one Groq call
(`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, available on Groq's free tier) to edit the LaTeX
directly — rephrasing and reordering existing bullets/skills to foreground
what the listing cares about, without inventing new experience — then
compiles the result to PDF with Tectonic. Third stage of the pipeline
(`search_listings → analyze_listing → personalize_resume → submit_application`).
Makes no Playwright calls of its own.

An earlier version of this service parsed resumes into a fixed structured
schema (contact/education/experience/... as separate JSON fields) and
rendered that into a Jinja2 LaTeX template. That was dropped: real resumes
don't reliably conform to one template, so parsing into rigid fields breaks
or silently drops content whenever a resume's structure deviates from what
the schema expects. Editing the LaTeX source directly sidesteps that — the
model works with whatever structure the resume already has, touching only
wording and ordering, not markup.

The tradeoff: the old approach could validate its output structurally
(bullet counts matched, skills came from a fixed pool). This one can't — the
model is trusted to follow the prompt's constraints (no invented experience,
preamble left untouched, valid LaTeX escaping). The one hard backstop that
remains is Tectonic itself: if the model's edits break the LaTeX, compiling
it fails loudly (500) rather than silently shipping a broken PDF.

## Endpoint

`POST /personalize-resume`

```jsonc
// request
{
  "resumeLatex": "\\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}\n...\\end{document}",
  "values": {
    "required_skills": ["Python", "SQL"],
    "preferred_skills": ["AWS"],
    "keywords": ["Agile", "CI/CD"],
    "values": ["collaborative", "fast-paced"],
    "summary": "A full-stack internship building internal tools and dashboards."
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// response
{
  "resumeFile": "<base64-encoded PDF bytes>",
  "filename": "resume.pdf"
}
```

`resumeFile` is base64-encoded for JSON transport. The orchestrator decodes
it back into an in-memory buffer before passing it to `submit_application`'s
`setInputFiles()` call.

`GET /health` reports liveness and whether `GROQ_API_KEY` is configured.

## Setup

```bash
cd services/personalize_resume
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in GROQ_API_KEY
```

You also need [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/) on your
`PATH` (it self-fetches whatever LaTeX packages it needs, so no separate
TeX Live install is required):

```bash
brew install tectonic   # macOS
```

## Run the service

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8003
```

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
json.dump({
    'resumeLatex': open('/path/to/resume.tex').read(),
    'values': {
        'required_skills': ['Python', 'SQL'],
        'preferred_skills': ['AWS'],
        'keywords': ['Agile', 'CI/CD'],
        'values': ['collaborative', 'fast-paced'],
        'summary': 'Whatever the target listing is about.',
    },
}, open('/tmp/request.json', 'w'))
"

curl -s localhost:8003/personalize-resume \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d @/tmp/request.json | jq -r '.resumeFile' | base64 -d > /tmp/resume.pdf
```
